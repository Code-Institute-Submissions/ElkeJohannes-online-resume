                                    As a senior consultant I help a company improve its efficiency by implementing new 
                                    systems and finding ways to improve existing ones. I also find ways to 
                                    make a company more profitable by increasing revenues and lowering costs. Using my 
                                    previous consulting experience, I am responsible for leading a team and making 
                                    high-level business decisions. I am trusted to create my own work and delegate tasks to others.
                                </p>
                                <p class="work-description">

                                    What is also very important is that I tought the junior consultants a lot of 
                                    secondary skills. This includes the coffee-getting skills of course, but also 
                                    the other skills that make our company stand out. For example when a junior trained
                                    by me walks into a new office on the first day, I want them to slam down their briefcase
                                    on a random persons desk and proclaim: 'Alright, starting today, things are going to be 
                                    radically different!'. I feel like it's important to be very clear about one's intentions
                                    from the start. 
                                </p>

                                    Dispatched to serveral organisations throughout the mid to northern part of the 
                                    land. Activities mostly involved examining the existing server environment, writing 
                                    reports on possible improvements followed by participation in projects to implement 
                                    those improvements. My specialities where in the Windows deployments, with a focus on 
                                    Server 2008R2 and Hyper-V. Additionally I implemented a lot of clustered Exchange environments.

                                    A very important, but often overlooked aspect of being a consultant is the ability
                                    to sense when a customer requires more coffee. So for example I was at one site once
                                    where this systemsadministrator was like: 'I don't drink coffee'. But using my fifth sense
                                    as a professional consultant, I knew that what he meant was he needed coffee now more than
                                    ever but simply had never had good coffee. So I went and got him some, then locked him up in 
                                    his office to enjoy it in privacy. That was my last day on the job there, but I'm sure 
                                    someone found him and let him out. It's fine. Probably.

                                    merged the three print servers into one. I also contributed to projects outside of

                                    So as an example of one of the projects I contributed to outside of the IT scope
                                    was the redecorating of the halls. Someone suggested that it felt a bit 
                                    clinical white, so the management's first solution was to lay down some carpet
                                    but then I as a seasoned interior designer weighed in that there should be 
                                    at least a couple of plants. Naturally it was way better afterwards.

                                    I also cleaned out the dishwasher on a regular basis. Someone has to do it
                                    after all, and they were all looking at me because I was the only one who regularly
                                    washed his hands so it seemed the most sanitary decision. There was of course also
                                    the super important task of organising the network cables. So basically I 
                                    would take the CAT5E cables and roll them all up nicely. Honestly you wouldn't believe 
                                    the mess these Networkadministrators make when they come back from a job. They just open 
                                    the storage room door, throw the cables in and quickly close it before anything 
                                    falls out.
